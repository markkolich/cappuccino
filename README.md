# cappuccino

A simple, and somewhat lame, web-server for Windows backed by Restlet.

On Windows, download and run a <a href="http://markkolich.github.com/downloads/cappuccino/0.4/cappuccino-0.4.exe">single .exe</a> and with **no installation**, Cappuccino gives you a web-server on localhost:8080 that serves static content from the directory you started it from (from where you ran the .exe).

Ideal for when you're on a Windows box (or a VM), and need to share large files with co-workers or friends the local network.

Written in Java, but doesn't mean you need a JVM installed to run Cappuccino &mdash; the binary ships with a self-contained JRE thanks to 7zip SFX.
