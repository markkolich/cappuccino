# cappuccino

A simple, and somewhat lame, web-server for Windows backed by Restlet.

On Windows, download a <a href="https://github.com/markkolich/cappuccino/raw/master/downloads/cappuccino-0.4.exe">single .exe</a> and with **no installation**, Cappuccino gives you a web-server on localhost:8080 that serves static content from the directory you started it from (where you ran the .exe).

Ideal for when you're on a Windows box (or VM), and need to share large files with co-workers or friends the local network.

## Latest Version

Latest version is 0.4.  You can download it <a href="https://github.com/markkolich/cappuccino/raw/master/downloads/cappuccino-0.4.exe">here</a>.
