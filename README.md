# cappuccino

A simple, and somewhat lame, web-server for Windows backed by Restlet.

## Usage

On Windows, download and run <a href="http://markkolich.github.com/downloads/cappuccino/0.4/cappuccino-0.4.exe">cappuccino-0.4.exe</a>. With *no installation*, Cappuccino gives you a web-server on <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a> that serves static content from the directory you started it from &mdash; from where you launched the .exe.

Ideal for when you're on a Windows box, or a Windows VM, and need to share large files with co-workers or friends the local network.

Written in Java, but doesn't mean you need a JVM installed to run Cappuccino &mdash; the binary ships with a self-contained JRE &mdash; that you never see and don't have to install &mdash; thanks to 7zip SFX.

## Latest Version

The latest version is 0.4.

You can download it <a href="http://markkolich.github.com/downloads/cappuccino/0.4/cappuccino-0.4.exe">here</a>.
